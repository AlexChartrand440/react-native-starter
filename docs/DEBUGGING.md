# Debugging

You might get issues that only happens when you are in a release environnement. We don't want to build a release on a developer's computer, but most likely using services for that, as AppCenter. Even though, it's possible to tweak some files to run a release build on your device or a simulator and let you debug this tricky issue.

Follow these two guides:

- [iOS](/DEBUGGING_IOS.md)
- [Android](/DEBUGGING_ANDROID.md)
